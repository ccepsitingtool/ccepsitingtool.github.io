            <h4 class="lead">Percentage of Students Proficient in Reading</h4>
            <p>The 2013 DC CAS results in reading for neighborhoods by student’s residence indicates that 40% of DC neighborhoods have less than half of their students scoring proficient in reading. Half of all DC neighborhoods have less than 53% of their students proficient in reading. The highest performing three neighborhoods, which are clustered in Northwest DC, have 90% or more of their students proficient in reading. Friendship Heights, American University Park, Tenleytown neighborhood in NW DC has 94% of its students scoring proficient in reading while Historic Anacostia neighborhood in SE DC has 35% of its students scoring proficient in reading.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a simplistic correlational analysis revealed that on average the higher the child poverty rate in the neighborhood, the lower the percentage of students proficient in reading. The median poverty rate was 52% for the ten neighborhoods with the lowest percentage of students proficient in reading in DC.</p>
